Bigint [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ChrisBuchholz/Bigint.png)](http://travis-ci.org/ChrisBuchholz/Bigint)
======

Bigint is a simple library I have created to carry a number with the trades
of an integer, but with an, seemingly, infinite length.

Bigint is immature and I have only created it, and is so far only using it, to
solve the [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/problems) problems that one
can only solve if he is able to calculate with big, big numbers.
