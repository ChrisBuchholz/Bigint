Bigint [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ChrisBuchholz/Bigint.png)](http://travis-ci.org/ChrisBuchholz/Bigint)
======

Bigint is a simple library I have created to carry a number with the trades
of an integer, but with an, seemingly, infinite length.

It's immature and I have only created, and is so far only using it to solve
the [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/problems) problems that needs can
only be solved by calculating with big, big numbers.
